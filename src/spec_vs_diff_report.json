  "summary": "All three requested frontend requirements appear implemented: a new /contact route with both phone numbers as tel: links, header navigation updated to route to /contact on both desktop and mobile, and footer “Connect With Us” updated to show both numbers as tel: links. Some additional, non-requested UI/content enhancements were also introduced (e.g., office hours/extra contact info on the Contact page, and broader styling/config changes per the file summaries).",

      "reason": "REQ-1 only asks to create the /contact page and clearly render the two phone numbers as clickable tel: links; extra sections are not requested.",
