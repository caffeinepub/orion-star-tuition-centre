# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated Contact page and make the tuition centre phone numbers easily accessible site-wide.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new public route at `/contact` that displays the phone numbers `8754585354` and `9677219328` in English with click-to-call `tel:` links.
- Update the header navigation so the "Contact" item routes to `/contact` (instead of scrolling to the enquiry section), on both desktop and mobile menus.
- Add the same phone numbers to the footer "Connect With Us" area as clickable `tel:` links while keeping the existing footer styling consistent.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate to `/contact` from the header and can click either `8754585354` or `9677219328` to call; the same numbers are also visible and clickable in the footer across the site.
